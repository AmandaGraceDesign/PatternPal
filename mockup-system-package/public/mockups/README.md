# Custom Mockup Creation Guide 🎨

Welcome to your guide for creating stunning, realistic product mockups! Think of this as your roadmap from "placeholder pretty" to "portfolio perfect."

## Why Custom Mockups Matter

Your patterns deserve a stage that makes them shine! While our placeholder mockups are clean and functional, custom realistic mockups will:
- Make your patterns look touchable, real, and desirable
- Show customers exactly how your designs translate to physical products
- Elevate your brand from "nice" to "I need that NOW"
- Build trust through professional presentation

## Quick Reference Specs

### All Mockups Should Have:
- **Format**: PNG (with transparency preferred, or clean white/neutral background)
- **Minimum Size**: 800x800px
- **Recommended Size**: 1200x1200px or larger (for crisp display on all screens)
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square (1:1) for consistency
- **Color Space**: sRGB

- **Visible Area**: Approximately 70-80% of image (rest is background/shadow)
- **Pattern Positioning**: Centered on pillow surface
- **Coordinate Reference**: Current system uses coordinates ~(100, 100) to (700, 700) for an 800x800 image

### Photography Tips
- **Setting**: Staged on a neutral surface (white bed, beige sofa, wooden bench)
- **Angle**: 15-30 degree rotation from straight-on
- **Lighting**: Soft, natural window light from left or right
- **Depth**: Slightly fluffed/dimensional, not perfectly flat
- **Background**: Minimal—let the pillow be the star

- **Visible Area**: 60-70% of image is patterned wall
- **Pattern Positioning**: Upper 2/3 of image
- **Coordinate Reference**: ~(50, 50) to (750, 650) for an 800x800 image

### Photography Tips

## Pro Photography Tips 🌟

### Lighting: Your Secret Weapon
- **Golden Rule**: Soft, diffused light beats harsh light every time
- **Window Light**: Best friend for beginners (45° angle from subject)
- **Overcast Days**: Nature's softbox—perfect for even lighting
- **Avoid Flash**: Unless you know what you're doing, skip it
- **Reflectors**: White foam board bounces light beautifully (dollar store hack!)

### Composition That Pops
- **Rule of Thirds**: Center your product, but let it breathe
- **Negative Space**: 20-30% empty space around product feels balanced
- **Background Blur**: Slightly out-of-focus background = professional
- **Clean Background**: Remove clutter—patterns need a clean canvas

### Technical Settings (If Using DSLR/Mirrorless)
- **Aperture**: f/4-f/8 for good depth of field
- **ISO**: 100-400 for clean images (natural light is your friend!)
- **White Balance**: Auto or Daylight setting
- **Focus**: On the center of pattern area
- **File Format**: RAW if editing, JPEG if going straight to use

## Image Optimization Workflow

You've got your gorgeous photo—now let's make it web-ready without losing that beauty!

### Step 1: Edit Your Photo
1. **Crop to Square**: 1:1 aspect ratio
2. **Adjust Exposure**: Bright, but not blown out
3. **Enhance Contrast**: Slightly (5-15%)
4. **Sharpen**: Light sharpening for crisp edges
5. **Color Correct**: Neutral tones (not too warm/cool)

### Step 2: Resize & Export
1. **Dimensions**: Export at 1200x1200px (or 1600x1600px for extra quality)
2. **Format**: PNG-24 with transparency OR PNG-8/JPEG for solid backgrounds
3. **Quality**: 85-90% for JPEG, maximum for PNG
4. **Save As**: Descriptive name (e.g., `pillow-mockup-white-01.png`)

### Step 3: Optimize File Size
Use one of these tools to compress without losing quality:
- **TinyPNG** (tinypng.com): Drag & drop, magic compression
- **Squoosh** (squoosh.app): Google's image optimizer
- **ImageOptim** (Mac): Batch processing heaven
- **Photoshop**: "Save for Web" with quality slider

**Target**: Under 300KB per image (200KB is even better!)

## Pattern Area Coordinates Guide

When you add your custom mockups, you'll need to adjust the pattern area coordinates in `mockupTemplates.ts`. Here's how to find them:

### Method 1: Visual Estimation
1. Open your mockup in an image editor
2. Note the total dimensions (e.g., 1200x1200)
3. Identify where your pattern should appear
4. Estimate coordinates as percentages, then convert to pixels

**Example**: If pattern should cover center 60% of a 1200x1200 image:
- Left: 240px (20% from left edge)
- Top: 240px (20% from top edge)
- Width: 720px (60% of total)
- Height: 720px (60% of total)

### Method 2: Precise Measurement (Recommended)
1. Open mockup in Photoshop, GIMP, or similar
2. Use the Rectangle Selection tool
3. Draw exactly where pattern should appear
4. Note the X, Y, Width, Height in the info panel
5. Update coordinates in code

### Coordinates Format
```typescript
patternArea: {
  x: 240,      // pixels from left edge
  y: 240,      // pixels from top edge
  width: 720,  // pattern width in pixels
  height: 720  // pattern height in pixels
}
```

## Quality Checklist ✅

Before adding a mockup to your collection, make sure it ticks these boxes:

### Technical
- [ ] Square aspect ratio (1:1)
- [ ] At least 800x800px (1200x1200+ preferred)
- [ ] Clear pattern area with good contrast
- [ ] Under 500KB file size
- [ ] PNG format with good compression
- [ ] No visible compression artifacts

### Visual
- [ ] Well-lit (no harsh shadows or dark areas)
- [ ] In focus (especially pattern area)
- [ ] Neutral/minimal background
- [ ] Product looks natural and dimensional
- [ ] Clean, professional appearance
- [ ] Pattern area is flat or evenly curved (not distorted)

### Strategic
- [ ] Represents product realistically
- [ ] Shows pattern at appropriate scale
- [ ] Appeals to your target audience
- [ ] Matches your brand aesthetic
- [ ] Works well with various pattern styles

## Common Mistakes to Avoid 🚫

1. **Too Small**: Images under 600px look pixelated on modern screens
2. **Bad Lighting**: Shadows obscure pattern details
3. **Busy Background**: Competes with your gorgeous pattern
4. **Over-Editing**: Unnatural colors or over-sharpened edges
5. **Wrong Angle**: Extreme perspectives distort pattern
6. **Wrinkled Products**: Looks unprofessional
7. **Huge Files**: Slow loading times frustrate customers
8. **Inconsistent Style**: Mockups should feel like a family

## Implementation Workflow

### When You Have Your Custom Mockup:

1. **Save to Directory**
   - Place in `/public/mockups/`
   - Use descriptive naming: `pillow-linen-natural.png`

2. **Update Coordinates** (if needed)
   - Edit `src/lib/mockups/mockupTemplates.ts`
   - Adjust pattern area coordinates for your specific mockup
   - Test with different patterns to ensure good coverage

3. **Test Rendering**
   - View with various pattern styles (geometric, organic, detailed)
   - Check pattern scaling and tiling
   - Verify blend modes look natural

4. **Optimize If Needed**
   - If rendering looks off, adjust opacity/blend mode
   - Fine-tune coordinates for perfect placement
   - Test on different screen sizes

## FAQ & Troubleshooting

**Q: Can I use mockups I find on Pinterest?**
A: Only if they're explicitly marked as free for commercial use. When in doubt, don't use it.

**Q: How do I know if my pattern area coordinates are right?**
A: Test with a simple, recognizable pattern (like stripes). If it looks centered and properly scaled, you're golden!

**Q: My pattern looks stretched/distorted on the mockup.**
A: Check that your pattern area aspect ratio matches the pattern's intended proportions. For square products, use square coordinates.

**Q: Should I use photos with models or just products?**
A: Start with product-only. Add lifestyle shots later when you want to show context and use.

**Q: Can I mix realistic and placeholder mockups?**
A: Absolutely! Update them one at a time as you acquire better images.

**Q: File size is still too large after compression.**
A: Try exporting as JPEG instead of PNG, or reduce dimensions slightly (1000x1000 instead of 1200x1200).

## Your Next Steps 🎯

1. **Start Simple**: Update one mockup at a time
2. **DIY First**: Try photographing your own products (it's easier than you think!)
3. **Invest Gradually**: Buy premium mockups for products you sell most
4. **Build a Library**: Collect mockups in various styles for different occasions
5. **Stay Consistent**: Keep the same lighting/style across all mockups
